    abstract = {We formulate Wannier orbital overlap population and Wannier orbital Hamilton population to describe the contribution of different orbitals to electron distribution and their interactions. These methods, which are analogous to the well-known crystal orbital overlap population and crystal orbital Hamilton population, provide insight into the distribution of electrons at various atom centers and their contributions to bonding. We apply this formalism in the context of a plane-wave density functional theory calculation. This method provides a means to connect the non-local plane-wave basis to a localized basis by projecting the wave functions from a plane-wave density functional theory calculation to a localized Wannier orbital basis. The main advantage of this formulation is that the spilling factor is strictly zero for insulators and can systematically be made small for metals. We use our proposed method to study and obtain bonding and electron localization insights in five different materials.},

title = {Wannier90 as a community code: new features and applications},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Wannier90 is an open-source computer program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch states. It is interfaced to many widely used electronic-structure codes thanks to its independence from the basis sets representing these Bloch states. In the past few years the development of Wannier90 has transitioned to a community-driven model; this has resulted in a number of new developments that have been recently released in Wannier90 v3.0. In this article we describe these new functionalities, that include the implementation of new features for wannierisation and disentanglement (symmetry-adapted Wannier functions, selectively-localised Wannier functions, selected columns of the density matrix) and the ability to calculate new properties (shift currents and Berry-curvature dipole, and a new interface to many-body perturbation theory); performance improvements, including parallelisation of the core code; enhancements in functionality (support for spinor-valued Wannier functions, more accurate methods to interpolate quantities in the Brillouin zone); improved usability (improved plotting routines, integration with high-throughput automation frameworks), as well as the implementation of modern software engineering practices (unit testing, continuous integration, and automatic source-code documentation). These new features, capabilities, and code development model aim to further sustain and expand the community uptake and range of applicability, that nowadays spans complex and accurate dielectric, electronic, magnetic, optical, topological and transport properties of materials.}
