`pengwann` is a lightweight Python package for calculating descriptors of chemical bonding and local electronic structure from Wannier functions (as obtained from [Wannier90](https://wannier.org/)).

More specifically, `pengwann` can be used to calculate the WOHP (Wannier Orbital Hamilton Population) and/or the WOBI (Wannier Orbital Bond index) between a pair (or larger cluster) of atoms. These quantities are analogous to the pCOHP (projected Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population) and pCOBI (projected Crystal Orbital Bond Index) implemented in the [LOBSTER](http://www.cohp.de/) code, except that the local basis we choose to represent the Hamiltonian and the density matrix is comprised of Wannier functions rather than pre-defined atomic or pseudo-atomic orbitals. This choice of a Wannier basis has the advantage that (for energetically isolated bands) **the spilling factor is strictly 0**. For further details as to the advantages and disadvantages of using a Wannier basis, as well as the mathematical formalism behind `pengwann` in general, please see the [Methodology](./methodology) page.

Besides the [API reference](./api), a detailed use case of how `pengwann` can be used to derive WOHPs, WOBIs and the pDOS can be found on the [Examples](./examples) page.
