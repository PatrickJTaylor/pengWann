abstract = {Abstract Despite its simple chemical constitution and unparalleled technological importance, the phase-change material germanium telluride (GeTe) still poses fundamental questions. In particular, the bonding mechanisms in amorphous GeTe have remained elusive to date, owing to the lack of suitable bond-analysis tools. Herein, we introduce a bonding indicator for amorphous structures, dubbed “bond-weighted distribution function” (BWDF), and we apply this method to amorphous GeTe. The results underline a peculiar role of homopolar GeGe bonds, which locally stabilize tetrahedral fragments but not the global network. This atom-resolved (i.e., chemical) perspective has implications for the stability of amorphous “zero bits” and thus for the technologically relevant resistance-drift phenomenon.},

abstract = {Abstract A hexagonal phase in the ternary Ge–Se–Te system with an approximate composition of GeSe0.75Te0.25 has been known since the 1960s but its structure has remained unknown. We have succeeded in growing single crystals by chemical transport as a prerequisite to solve and refine the Ge4Se3Te structure. It consists of layers that are held together by van der Waals type weak chalcogenide–chalcogenide interactions but also display unexpected Ge–Ge contacts, as confirmed by electron microscopy analysis. The nature of the electronic structure of Ge4Se3Te was characterized by chemical bonding analysis, in particular by the newly introduced density of energy (DOE) function. The Ge–Ge bonding interactions serve to hold electrons that would otherwise go into antibonding Ge–Te contacts.},
